## Escola de software - Blog - Search BlogPost - Lambda Function

This repository contains the lambda function to search a blogpost.
The table already exists.

Don't forget, to be able to connect with S3 and DynamoDB the function will need two permissions.

- dynamodb:Query

The permission is "AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess" and it is AWS Managed.

Thanks a lot
